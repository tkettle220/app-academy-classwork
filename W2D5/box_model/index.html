    <p>Note the current height and width of each box now. The padding and border has been added on top of the original width we defined, so we should now have a total width and total height of 310px.
What if we don't want the padding and border to be added on top of the width, but rather be included in the total width calculation? We can accomplish this by setting the box-sizing property to border-box. Do this for the second box and note the results. Note how the content box has shrunken to allow room for the padding and border. NB: The default value for the box-sizing property is content-box.
Do box elements always need a set height and width to be visible? No! Play around with adding text into the p element and see how it expands and shrinks to accomodate its contents.
